			<p>
				Chapbook is a story format for Twine 2, which means that it plays
				stories created in Twine in a web browser.
			</p>
			<p>
				Chapbook is released under the
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT license</a>. It
				can be used to create commercial works without royalty payment or other
				arrangement.

				Chapbook is part of the official Twine 2 distribution, but you can also
				use it with this URL:

				<h2><em>Cloak of Darkness</em>, a sample story</h2>
				<p>
					Want a quick look at the output Chapbook produces, or the way you
					write a code for it? Take a look at the
					<a href="examples/cloak-of-darkness.html">story</a> and its
					<a href="examples/cloak-of-darkness.txt">Twee source code</a>. If
					you've never used Twee before, it's a compact text-only format for
					Twine stories. The main thing to keep in mind is that each line
					beginning with <code>::</code> describes a new passage.
