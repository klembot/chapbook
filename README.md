# Chapbook, a story format for Twine 2

_by Chris Klimas_

Chapbook is a story format for Twine 2, which means that it plays stories created in Twine in a web browser. It is now part of the official Twine 2 distribution, but you may also use it from this URL:

`https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/use/1.1.1/format.js`

There is also a micro build of Chapbook that strips out all debugging-related code, saving around 20 kilobytes of JavaScript, that is not packaged with Twine 2. To use that version, add this story format:

`https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/use/1.1.1-micro/format.js`

Chapbook is released under the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). It can be used to create commercial works without royalty payment or other arrangement.

-   ## _Cloak of Darkness_, a sample story 
    Want a quick look at the output Chapbook produces, or the way you write a code for it? Take a look at the [story](https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/examples/cloak-of-darkness.html) and its [Twee source code](https://klembot.github.io/chapbook/examples/cloak-of-darkness.txt). If you've never used Twee before, it's a compact text-only format for Twine stories. The main thing to keep in mind is that each line beginning with `::` describes a new passage.
