# Objects and Lookup Variables

In addition to variables you create, Chapbook also maintains a number of built-in variables called _lookups_. Unlike regular variables, lookups cannot be changed by you. Instead, they correspond to properties in the environment--the current date and time when the player is interacting with your story, for example, or even the story itself.

## Introducing Objects

In order to leave as many variable names available to you as possible, Chapbook groups its built-in lookup variables together using _objects_. An objects are another type of variable--like a string, boolean, or number--that acts as a container for other variables. Unlike simple variable types like strings or numbers, objects don't have values unto themselves. They only contain other variables.

To access a variable inside an object container, enter the object's name, then a period (`.`), then the variable. For instance, `story.name` accesses the variable named `name` inside of `story`.

You can nest objects as much as you'd like, and you can also write something like this in the vars section of a passage:

```
my.favorite.variable: 'red'
```

Chapbook will create each object variable (e.g. `my` and `favorite`) for you if it doesn't already exist.

## Built-In Lookup Variables

Below is a list of lookups that Chapbook maintains for you:

| `story.name`      | The name of the story as set in the Twine editor.                                                                                                                     | `'Untitled Story'`   |

Note that `now` lookup values reflect when they were last accessed, which is usually when a passage is navigated to. String values like `now.monthName` will vary by the language the player has set as default in their browser-- a French person will see `Ao√ªt` where an American sees `August`, for example, and similarly the French will see `now.datestamp` as `'15/2/2011'` where Americans see it as `'2/15/2011'`.
