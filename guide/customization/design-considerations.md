# Design Considerations

Players will spend quite a lot of time with your story simply reading its text, so they deserve a well-considered experience. Which is not to say the experience should always be comfortable. Cara Ellison's _[Sacrilege]_ has a searing purple background for its text and bright yellow links that turn green when you point at them, but all this is in service to its content. _Sacrilege's_ story is, in part, about the sensory overload of a nightclub, so it's fitting that the text itself somewhat overload the player's senses.[^1]

Fortunately, people have been designing reading experiences for centuries now, and there's quite a lot of accumulated wisdom on how to use type gracefully.

-   If you're new to typography, the best first port of call is Matthew
    Butterick's [Practical Typography](practical-typography). Butterick is
    opinionated and a bit patrician in some of his pronouncements, but his basic
    ideas are sound, and he takes the _Practical_ part of the name of his web
    site seriously.

-   The Yale Web Style Guide's [chapter on typography](yale-typography) is also
    worth reading, though it is intended for web designers and developers, who
    must build pages from the ground up.

-   If you find yourself truly intrigued by typography, it's worth tracking down
    a copy of _[The Elements of Typographical Style](typographical-style)_.

There is also a strange kind of science to selecting colors.

-   If you've never delved into color theory, try starting  with with the [Color
    Schemes](color-schemes) chapter of Rune Madsen's _Programming Design
    Systems_. It uses code examples using a programming language called
    [Processing](processing), but you can safely skim over them. If you find
    yourself intrigued by the subject, try the rest of Madsen's section on
    color.
-   Khan Academy has a free [online course on the science of color](khan-color)
    that talks about both how our eyes and brains perceive color, and the
    different color models used to represent color.
-   There's no substitute for simply playing with color. The best tool online
    for this is perhaps [Adobe Color CC](adobe-color), which is beginning to
    show its age but is still useful.
-   WebAIM has a [contrast checker](webaim-contrast) that ensures that the color
    scheme you design has sufficient contrast for low-vision players. Your colors should pass the WCAG AAA criteria for normal text.
